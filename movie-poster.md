# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:**  
- **Movie Title:**  The little mermaid
- **Why I chose this movie:**  its one of my favorite Disney movies

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion:**  wonder

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element:**  magical world under the sea
- **Why this element:**  it creates a feeling of wonder and interest because its so beautiful

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid:**  too many characters

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s):**  blues and greens
- **Accent color(s):**  purple and white
- **Overall mood:** (warm/cool/muted/vibrant/dark/bright)  bright and vibrant

**Composition:**  
- [ ] Close-up (face/detail)  Ariel looking sad and wanting more
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  Under the sea in her palace
- [ ] Medium shot (full figure)  Ariel sitting inside a shell
- [ ] Object/symbol centered  Ariel holding a map of the world
- [ ] Character collage Ariel is the focus character, and Flounder and Sebastian are next to her

- **Focal point description:**  

--- Ariel in her shell in the center

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt:**  make a movie cover from The Little Mermaid with Ariel in the center holding a world map while sitting in a shell bed. Make the scene underwater and the background her amazing colorful blues and green palace. Put Sebastian and flounder next to her


- **What worked:**  it is very magical looking and there is nice details
- **What didn't work:**  its a little boring and bland coloring
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  make it more elaborate

**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt:**  make it more colorful and lively with an even more magical background and make her shell bed more elaborate. Add the Little Mermaid title at the bottom

- **What worked:**  There were more details like the pearls on the bed and more mermaids in the back
- **What didn't work:**  It wouldn't put the title because its copyrighted
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  put Ariel on the beach

---

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt:**  now make her be on the beach with legs all dressed up like a princess with no shell and no fish

- **What worked:**  she has legs and is on the beach now
- **What didn't work:**  the sea palace is still in the back
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  bring price charming in on the beach

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt:**  
give her a fork instead of a map and insert price charming finding her on the beach
- **What worked:**  she got a fork and was found by Price Charming
- **What didn't work:**  

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?)  

--- I like the 2nd one the most because it is the most detailed and magical

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  
2.  
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  
She went from being in the water and in her palace to being out on shore. Her tail transformed into a dress and her flowing hair stayed the same. 


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  
The seashell bed with pearls


**What would you do differently next time?**  
I would spend more time on smaller details
